# SmartParking
This is a cross platform mobile application created using Ionic 4 framework with angular 7 and firebase Cloud db for storage and real time processing. This is an assistive smart parking management system that will enable users to view all available parking spaces in real time, providing reservation features for registered members, users can also file complain which will be received by the application admin logged on. upon arrival to UTECH the same app provides levels of access therefore admin will have access to an admin portal from which they can allocate, deallocate, view reports made by user, view all vehicles parked and their respective information as well as manage system.

  The implementation of the project Smart Campus will potentially increase the efficiency of the above-mentioned service 
  offered by the institution through the implementation of a mobile application called Smart Parking. This application 
  will notify members of the institution of all vacant parking spots on campus.  The assistive parking lot management 
  application will provide options for the staff to either select a parking lot beforehand; or be assigned a parking
  spot by the Security personnel upon entry of the institution along with other motorists.  Only staff members using the
  mobile application can reserve a parking spot in advance. Students using the application can only reserve a parking spot
  15 minutes prior to their arrival on campus or immediately up arrival at the front gate. If a motorist does not have the 
  application, the security guard will have the ability to view the available spots from the application and assign one. 
  The development of the Smart Parking application will ensure efficiency in the allotment of parking spaces and secure 
  monitoring of vehicles parked as unlike the current system, as now the security guards will know exactly where vehicles 
  are parked to allow for easier monitoring.
  The Smart Parking application will significantly benefit the University in that it will:
    Allow for the efficient allotment of parking spaces to vehicle owners
    Allow for the monitoring of vehicles in the parking lot.
    Help reduce chaos and hassle of finding an available parking spot faced by vehicle owners under the current system.
  This project will deliver an innovative assistive parking lot management system to the UTECH through the use of technology 
  such as crowdsourcing, quick response code (qrc) delivered over mobile devices using modern application development 
  techniques.  Staff and students alike will not be burdened with late arrival for classes and appointments with rapid 
  identification of available spaces. It will also help with controlling the traffic on the schoolâ€™s grounds as motorists  
  will no longer have to traverse the entire campus multiple times in search of an empty parking spot. 
  This project, though conducted on the grounds of the UTECH will produce results that may prove beneficial on an immensely  
  large scale. With the progression of time, motor vehicles have become more accessible and as such the metropolitan area in  
  St. Andrew and Kingston, has been met with an influx of residents owning motor vehicles.  In traversing to work, school or  
  going about everyday norms, motorists will forever rely on a system implemented by the destinations they are visiting to  
  securely park their vehicle in the easiest and most efficient way possible.  The study being carried out by the Smart Campus 
  team will provide useful information on how it is that parking systems may be aided with the use of technology to improve  
  the overall satisfaction of all parties involved. It can be concluded that the implementation of the assistive parking lot 
  management system application will pose significant benefits to the reputation of the University going forward and also in 
  improving significantly on the current system employed. Smart Parking can be the first step towards becoming a Smart Campus.
